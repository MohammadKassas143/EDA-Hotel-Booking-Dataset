# Hotel Booking Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset to extract meaningful insights that can help optimize revenue strategies. The analysis covers data preprocessing, handling missing values, exploring booking patterns, customer demographics, and seasonal trends that impact revenue generation.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and removing non-informative columns.
- Analyze customer booking behaviors and identify key factors influencing cancellations.
- Examine seasonal trends and peak booking periods.
- Identify pricing strategies and customer preferences to optimize revenue.
- Visualize insights using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains booking information, including:
- Customer details (excluding personal identifiers)
- Booking dates, lead time, and stay duration
- Cancellation status
- Room type preferences
- Pricing details
- Market segment information

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed unnecessary columns (*company*, *agent*).
   - Handled missing values appropriately.
   - Checked for duplicate entries and inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized booking trends across different seasons.
   - Analyzed cancellation patterns and their impact on revenue.
   - Identified correlations between lead time, pricing, and booking confirmations.
   - Examined customer segmentation to tailor marketing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)

## Key Insights
- Cancellations are significantly influenced by lead time and pricing strategies.
- Demand is highest during specific seasons, suggesting the need for dynamic pricing.
- Summer could be a strategic season to prioritize resort bookings for maximizing revenue.
